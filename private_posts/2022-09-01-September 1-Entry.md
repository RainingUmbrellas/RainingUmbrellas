Today, I worked on an ATM app that will serve as an example. The app is spread across two repositories. It's a fairly simple application that would need proper error handling.

When I got home, I wanted to try using my credit to deploy something fully, but I honestly am not sure which options to use.

i did start looking at the learning path for az 104 and I think it might be benefical to go through the paths, because it seems to be explaining things that aren't explained in the 204, but i do understand that 104 doesn't have a big incentive for it.

So maybe learning more about the azure portal and its services would be more benefical and when I'm ready to try again with that $200, i could create another account (probably with a textnow number) or actally just set aside $200 credit to use in 30 day
