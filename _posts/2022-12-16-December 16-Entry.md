Today I took the AZ-204 Exam and ...

I failed :)

Normally, I would be bummed out about failing a test, but I wasn't super confident in the material and I had a feeling that I was completely clear on all the concepts.

However, I think the thing that is helping me stay positive about this failing exam is how close i was to passing. I scored 672, which is 28 points away from passing. For someone who has had about less than 6 months of experience in Azure (and that is a generous estimate), I think my score wasn't that bad.

Taking the exam also refreshed me on the mindset of test taking and helped me see what kind of questions I was going to get. ESI practice exams were pretty similar to the real test so I'm probably going to use it again.

I also liked how the exam at the end gave some suggested areas for me to work on.

I guess also just being done with the exam for now really takes some weight off of my shoulders.

The game plan for now is
Short Term:

- get some rest / try to go to bed at a good time
- Don't stay up so late studying
- Try not to cram, but instead spread out my studying to a few hours every few days or whatever
- Go into Azure and start making things

Long Term:

- Try to launch the Miss Odyssey Pageant App in Azure and try to use as many services as possible (when appropriate)
- Come up with other smaller projects to use the services in different ways.
- Try to make blog entries more and revamp this github page account
