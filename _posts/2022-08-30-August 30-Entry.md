Since I have only 11-12 days left on my free $200 credit, I think I should try to use my credit and have the goal of getting a react app deployed. This app will be similar to the thoughts app, but just something a little different to keep interest (Crystal Gems).

Maybe just get thoughts- Meeting of the Minds (F & B) deployed by upgrading app service plan since I think that was working at one point.
